Hero Section Presentation Notes
1. Introduction

I created a Hero Section using React + Tailwind CSS.

The Hero Section is the first part of a webpage that grabs attention.

Mine focuses on radiant natural skin (theme: beauty + confidence).

2. Design Choices

Layout: Centered hero text + button + background image → clean and modern.

Colors: Soft, natural tones (beige/cream/white) for calm, elegant feel.

Fonts: Tailwind’s default sans-serif → professional and minimal.

Images: Natural skin/beauty picture → connects to theme of “radiance.”

3. Use of Tailwind CSS

Used utility classes (e.g., flex, items-center, justify-center) for fast styling.

Applied responsive design (looks good on desktop + mobile).

Used rounded corners, shadows, padding → modern UI.

Tailwind let me avoid writing extra CSS files.

4. Challenges

Struggled with image sizing & alignment → solved using object-cover and h-screen.

At first, I used too many classes → learned to simplify.

GitHub repository management was confusing → learned how to upload properly.

5. What I Learned

How to build a component in React (App.js).

How to style quickly with Tailwind CSS utilities.

How to make a GitHub repository and upload project files.

Importance of responsive, clean design for user experience.

6. Conclusion

My Hero Section communicates natural beauty & confidence.

It’s simple, elegant, and functional.

This project taught me not just coding, but also problem-solving & design thinking.
