Project Overview

The goal was to design a modern and engaging Hero Section for a landing page that highlights a theme of Radiant Skin & Self-Care.

It demonstrates:

Clean React component structure.

Responsive Tailwind CSS styling.

Large, eye-catching headline text.

Clear call-to-action buttons.

A design that adapts to different screen sizes.

Design Choices

Layout: Centered content with a full-screen hero for maximum impact.

Colors: Soft neutral background with contrasting bold text for readability.

Fonts: Large, modern sans-serif font for the headline (“Radiant Skin Naturally”).

Buttons: Bigger size, rounded corners, hover effects for interactivity.

Images: Hero background with self-care/skincare theme to match the headline.

 How I Used Tailwind CSS

Utility classes for spacing, alignment, colors, and font sizes.

Responsive design using md:, lg:, etc.

flex and grid layouts for balance.

Custom large font sizes (text-6xl, text-7xl) for the headline.

Challenges I Faced

Font Sizes: At first, my heading (“Radiant Skin Naturally”) looked too small, and I struggled to scale it up properly. I fixed this using Tailwind’s larger text utilities and custom classes.

Button Styling: Initially, my buttons were too small and not balanced. I learned to adjust padding (px-8 py-4) and text size (text-lg) to make them stand out.

Layout Balance: Some elements looked “pushed down.” I solved this by using flexbox alignment (flex, items-center, justify-center) to center everything.

 What I Learned

How to structure a React component cleanly.

Practical use of Tailwind CSS utility classes.

How to make text, buttons, and layout responsive across devices.

The importance of design balance between text size, button size, and spacing.
